I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here.. Step 2: Input: Whatever was output from step 1, plus maybe whatever else is needed (libraries? DLLs? .so? .lib? ) Process: whatever is done with the input Output: whatever is output and so on..

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here..

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here.. Step 2: Input: Whatever was output from step 1, plus maybe whatever else is needed (libraries? DLLs? .so? .lib? ) Process: whatever is done with the input Output: whatever is output and so on..

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here..

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here..

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here.. Step 2: Input: Whatever was output from step 1, plus maybe whatever else is needed (libraries? DLLs? .so? .lib? ) Process: whatever is done with the input Output: whatever is output and so on..

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this?

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state..

As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here.. Step 2: Input: Whatever was output from step 1, plus maybe whatever else is needed (libraries? DLLs? .so? .lib? ) Process: whatever is done with the input Output: whatever is output and so on..

I'd like to write a teeny app that has nothing but a taskbar icon that does nothing but move the mouse by 1 pixel every 4 minutes. I can do that in 3 ways with Delphi (my strong language) but I'm moving to C# for work and I'd like to know the path of least resistance there.

I can't seem to figure out how compilation works.. To be more specific, here's an example.. I'm trying to write some code in MSVC++ 6 to load a Lua state.. I've already: set the additional directories for the library and include files to the right directories used extern \"C\" (because Lua is C only or so I hear) include'd the right header files But i'm still getting some errors in MSVC++6 about unresolved external symbols (for the Lua functions that I used). As much as I'd like to know how to solve this problem and move on, I think it would be much better for me if I came to understand the underlying processes involved, so could anyone perhaps write a nice explanation for this? What I'm looking to know is the process.. It could look like this: Step 1: Input: Source code(s) Process: Parsing (perhaps add more detail here) Output: whatever is output here.. Step 2: Input: Whatever was output from step 1, plus maybe whatever else is needed (libraries? DLLs? .so? .lib? ) Process: whatever is done with the input Output: whatever is output and so on.. Thanks.. Maybe this will explain what symbols are, what exactly \"linking\" is, what \"object\" code or whatever is.. Thanks.. Sorry for being such a noob.. P.S. This doesn't have to be language specific.. But feel free to express it in the language you're most comfortable in.. :) EDIT: So anyway, I was able to get the errors resolved, it turns out that I have to manually add the .lib file to the project; simply specifying the library directory (where the .lib resides) in the IDE settings or project settings does not work.. However, the answers below have somewhat helped me understand the process better. Many thanks!.. If anyone still wants to write up a thorough guide, please do.. :) EDIT: Just for additional reference, I found two articles by one author (Mike Diehl) to explain this quite well.. :) Examining the Compilation Process: Part 1 Examining the Compilation Process: Part 2 "},"_index":"so500k","_score":2.5633497},{"_id":"r8hWPo4B7J6k9o5uiIVj","_source":{"user":"33165","tags":["iphone","cocoa","cocoa-touch"],"questionId":"442491","creationDate":"2009-01-14T10:09:02.523","title":"Hiding the Keyboard","acceptedAnswerId":"442876","type":"question","body":"I have a UISearchBar and on the delegate method I hide the keyboard when the text field is cleared: - (void)searchBar:(UISearchBar *)filterBar textDidChange:(NSString *)filterText { NSLog(@\"filter: %@\", filterText); if ([filterText length] == 0) { NSLog(@\"hiding keyboard\"); [filterBar resignFirstResponder ]; Now when I use the backspace button to clear out the search term all is good. The keyboard hides when the search turns to empty. Not so when I am pressing the \"cross\" button to clear out the search field altogether. Well, not entirely true. I does call resignFirstResponder and hides the keyboard - you just can't see it because it comes right back up. I found this out by observing the keyboard show/hide events. So how come the keyboard is shown again? How can I prevent this? I've already tried to walk all subviews of the UISearchBar and also call resignFirstResponder on those ...but unless I did something wrong - that doesn't solve this either. Update: In fact I just got the keyboard to not disable the \"Done\" button :-D ...so I will \"stop\" going down that road as Kevin suggested. Still I would like to know why the keyboard came back up like this.

The reason I am asking this is because it's really hard to test for possible threading issues, as it doesn't occur all the time.
