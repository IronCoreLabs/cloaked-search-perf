Right now I have located the most time consuming loop in the thread (it does only compression) and use GetTickCount() and Sleep() with hardcoded values. It makes sure that the loop continues for a certain period of time and than sleeps for a certain minimal time. It more or less does the job i.e. guarantees that the thread will not use more than 50% of CPU. However behavior is dependent on the number of CPU cores (huge disadvantage) and simply ugly (smaller disadvantage :)). Any ideas?
