In the MainFrame there are menu and status window (custom window). The video size width:height ratio is 4:3 so in the case there are some other elements on the screen the video doesn't fill the whole area. This is the function which arranges screen elements: int CMainFrame::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct) { ToggleFullScreen(TRUE); CScreenOrientation::SetScreenOrientation(270); if (CFrameWnd::OnCreate(lpCreateStruct) == -1) return -1; RECT r; GetWindowRect(&r); if (!m_wndStatus.Create(NULL, NULL, WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, CRect(0, 0, r.right, TOOLBAR_HEIGHT), this, AFX_IDW_PANE_FIRST + 1, NULL)) { TRACE0(\"Failed to create status view\\n\"); return -1; } // Create a camera view if (!m_wndCameraView.Create(NULL, NULL, AFX_WS_DEFAULT_VIEW, CRect(0, 0, 0, 0), this, AFX_IDW_PANE_FIRST, NULL)) { TRACE0(\"Failed to create camera view\\n\"); return -1; } m_wndCameraView.SetLogDirectory(m_Settings.m_LogDirectory); if (!m_wndCommandBar.Create(this) || !m_wndCommandBar.AddAdornments(dwAdornmentFlags) || !m_wndCommandBar.InsertMenuBar(IDR_MAINFRAME)) { TRACE0(\"Failed to create CommandBar\\n\"); return -1; // fail to create } m_wndCommandBar.SetBarStyle(m_wndCommandBar.GetBarStyle() | CBRS_SIZE_FIXED); m_QueueProgressData.SetHandle(this); // Update GUI state UpdateGUIState(); //VideoPreviewShow(); // TODO: check error m_SleepModeTimerID = SetTimer(1, (UINT)1000, (TIMERPROC)CMainFrame::SleepModeTimer); PostMessage(WM_CHECK_UPGRADE, 0, 0); return 0; } Does anyone know if there is a way to fill the blank area (the area not filled by status window and menu bar) with video preview without changing the width:height ratio (overwrite a part of video preview with status bar and menu) perhaps with changing the Window Styles flags or any other approach?

The page only really covers C# language bits and bobs, but I also find core .NET things interesting too. For example, here's one which isn't on the page, but which I find incredible: string x = new string(new char[0]); string y = new string(new char[0]); Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(x, y)); I'd expect that to print False - after all, \"new\" (with a reference type) always creates a new object, doesn't it? The specs for both C# and the CLI indicate that it should. Well, not in this particular case. It prints True, and has done on every version of the framework I've tested it with. (I haven't tried it on Mono, admittedly...) Just to be clear, this is only an example of the kind of thing I'm looking for - I wasn't particularly looking for discussion/explanation of this oddity. (It's not the same as normal string interning; in particular, string interning doesn't normally happen when a constructor is called.) I was really asking for similar odd behaviour. Any other gems lurking out there?

I am witting an application in pure 'c' to the Win32 API. There is an ODBC connection to a database which will retrieve the items (actually rows). The MSDN sample code implies a fixed size buffer of 30 for the end cache (Which would almost certainly not be optimal). I think the end cache and the main cache should be the same size. My thinking is that the buffer should be more than the maximum number of items that could be displayed by the list view at one time. I guess this could be re-calculated each t
