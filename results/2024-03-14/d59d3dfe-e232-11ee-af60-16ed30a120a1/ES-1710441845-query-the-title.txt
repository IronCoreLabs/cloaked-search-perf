For example, if I am using a Courier font, (not italic!) and I measure \"P\" I get 90, but \"PP\" gives me 150. I would expect a monospace font to give exactly double the width for \"PP\". My question is: is this intended or documented behaviour, and how do I disable this?

This can be when a co-worker / boss suggested a solution which would violate the fundamental limits of computation, or when you realized yourself that a problem you were trying to solve was, in fact, impossible to solve. The most recent time I came up with it was when studying type checkers. Our class realized that it would be impossible to write a perfect type checker (one that would accept all programs that would run without type errors, and reject all programs that would run with type errors) because this would, in fact, solve the halting problem. Another was when we realized, in the same class, that it would be impossible to determine whether a division would ever occur by zero, in the type-checking stage, because checking whether a number, at run-time, is zero, is also a version of the halting problem.

By the way, I am talking about connection oriented sockets (stream sockets, TCP, ...). This is the simplified server code (I ommit error checking on system calls here just for simplicity): int main() { int server_socket, connected_socket; struct sockaddr_in server_addr; char buf[1024]; char aux[256]; int bytes_read; server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET; server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; server_addr.sin_port = htons(1234); bind(server_socket, &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) listen(server_socket, 5) connected_sodket = accept(server_socket, 0, 0); do { bzero(buf, sizeof(buf)); bytes_read = read(connected_socket, buf, sizeof(buf)); } while (bytes_read > 0); /* Here I want to use connected_socket to write the reply, can I? */ close(connected_socket); close(server_socket); return (EXIT_SUCCESS); } And this is the simplified client code (I ommit error checking on system calls here just for simplicity): int main() { int client_socket; struct sockaddr_in server_addr; client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); hp = gethostbyname(\"myhost\"); server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET; memcpy(&server_addr.sin_addr, hp->h_addr_list[0], hp->h_length); server_addr.sin_port = htons(1234); connect(client_socket, &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)); write(client_socket, MSG, sizeof(MSG)); /* Here I want to wait for a response from the server using client_socket, can I? */ close(client_socket); return (EXIT_SUCCESS); } Can I use connected_socket in the server and client_socket in the client to pass a response message back? Or should I use the client address I get in the server when in \"accept\" to connect to a socket in the client?
